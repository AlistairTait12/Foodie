# Foodie

This is a small Ruby application about the dilema of not being able to plan your meals throughout the week

The current application only runs in the command line, but I later intend to create a GUI, either through implementation via Ruby Shoes or transforming this into some form of rails app

Within the app is stored several meal inspiration ideas that will be generated and output to the console based on the user preferences. For example, they can choose tags such as "healthy" or "easy" and it will generate the appropriate meal inspitation.

Future plans to add features such as a GUI, added functionality such as meal analysis etc.
