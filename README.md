This is a small application about the dilema of not being able to plan your meals throughout the week

Within the app is stored several meal inspiration ideas that will be generated and output to the console based on the user preferences. For example, they can choose tags such as "healthy" or "easy" and it will generate the appropriate meal inspitation.

Future plans to add features such as a GUI, added functionality such as meal analysis etc.
